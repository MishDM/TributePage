			<h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Steve Job's life:</h2>
			<ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
				<br>
				<li><b>born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur, investor, and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO,
						and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.;
						founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated net
						worth of around US$273 billion as of April 2022,[6] Musk is the wealthiest person in the world
						according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and the Forbes real-time billionaires
						list.[7][8]</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father, and raised in Pretoria, South
						Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17 to
						avoid conscription. He was enrolled at Queen's University and transferred to the University of
						Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He
						moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a
						business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup
						was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank
						X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in
						2002 for $1.5 billion.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of
						which he is CEO and Chief Engineer. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla
						Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In
						2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company that was later acquired by
						Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that
						promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology
						company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a
						tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain
						transportation system</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1976</b> - In 1976 he and Wozniak formed their own company. They called it Apple Computer
					Company, in memory of a happy summer Jobs had spent picking apples. They raised $1,300 in startup
					money by selling Jobs's microbus and Wozniak's calculator. At first they sold circuit boards (the
					boards that hold the internal components of a computer) while they worked on the computer prototype
					(sample).</li>
				<br>
				<li>Musk has been criticized for unorthodox and unscientific stances and highly publicized controversial
					statements. In 2018, he was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely
					tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC,
					temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and agreeing to limitations on his Twitter usage. In
					2019, he won a defamation trial brought against him by a British caver who advised in the Tham Luang
					cave rescue. Musk has also been criticized for spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic
					and for his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and public
					transport.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[9] His mother is Maye Musk
					(née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[10][11][12] but raised in South
					Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor,
					consultant, and property developer who was once a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake
					Tanganyika.[13][14] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca
					(born 1974).[12][15] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born
					Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to
					Africa and Australia;[16][17][18] and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1988</b> - Jobs soon hired some of his former employees to begin a new computer company called
					NeXT. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced at a large gala event in San Francisco, aimed at
					the educational market. Initial reactions were generally good. The product was very user-friendly,
					and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays, and an outstanding sound system.
					Despite the warm reception, however, the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly, had a
					black-and-white screen, and could not be linked to other computers or run common software.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1986</b> - NeXT was not, however, the end of Steve Jobs. In 1986 Jobs purchased a small company
					called Pixar from filmmaker George Lucas (1944–). Pixar specialized in computer animation. Nine
					years later Pixar released Toy Story, a huge box office hit. Pixar later went on to make Toy Story 2
					and A Bug's Life, which Disney distributed, and Monsters, Inc. All these films have been extremely
					successful. Monsters, Inc. had the largest opening weekend ticket sales of any animated film in
					history.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Aware that it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[33] Musk applied for a
					Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[34][35] While awaiting the documentation, he
					attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in
					the South African military.[36] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second cousin
					in Saskatchewan for a year,[37] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[38] In 1990, he entered
					Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[39][40] Two years later, he transferred to the University
					of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor
					of Science degree in economics</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2005</b> - Steve Jobs with his Apple team began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first
					iPhone was released on June 29, 2007. The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated
					six out of ten Americans were aware of its release. Time declared it "Invention of the Year" for
					2007.</li>
				<br>
				<li>In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup
					Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and
					at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.[45] In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of
					Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California.[46] Musk
					attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries.[34] He dropped
					out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet
					startup.</li>

			<p class="font">Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and
				Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[99] Both men played
				active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[100] Musk led the Series A
				round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and
				joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[101][102] Musk took an active role within the company and
				oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[103]
				Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted
				from the firm.[104][105] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in
				2008.[106] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with
				Tarpenning and two others.[107][108] As of 2019, Elon Musk was the longest tenured CEO of any automotive
				manufacturer globally.[109] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to Technoking while retaining his
				position as CEO.
